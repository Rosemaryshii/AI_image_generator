# AI_image_generator

 I've shown how to build an AI-powered Image Generation Website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. On this website, users enter their prompt and select a number of AI-generated images they want to be created. They can also download their images by clicking on the download button. This website is similar to MidJourney and DALL-E and works on all devices.
 This project makes use of the Fetch API.
 It uses OpenAI..
 You need to have your own private API Token to generate the Images.
 Incase of any challenges with this project email me at Developerwanjiru@gmail.com
